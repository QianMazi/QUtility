\title{Calculates weighted returns for a portfolio of assets}
\usage{
Return.rebalancing_yrf(R, weights = NULL, rebFreq = NA, fee.buy = 0,
  fee.sell = 0, verbose = FALSE, geometric = TRUE,
  warning.wgtsum = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{R}{an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries or zoo object of asset returns}

\item{weights}{a time series or a vector containing asset weights. Note that the sum of weights is not required to be 1. If the sum is smaller to 1,the remnant weight is set to 'cash',and the portfolio is treated as an unfull-position portfolio;if the sum is larger than 1, the extra weight is set as liability, and the portfolio is treated as a leveraged portfolio. See detail in examples.}

\item{rebFreq}{Default "na", alternatively "day", "weeks", "month", "quarter", and "year". to specify calendar-period rebalancing supported by \code{\link[xts]{endpoints}}.}

\item{fee.buy}{a single-row matrix or a vector containing buying fee of each assets. It also could be a numeric scalar, which means all the assets have the same fee.}

\item{fee.sell}{a single-row matrix or a vector containing selling fee of each assets. It also could be a numeric scalar, which means all the assets have the same fee.}

\item{verbose}{a logic. If TRUE, return a list of intermediary calculations}

\item{geometric}{a logical. generate geometric (TRUE) or simple (FALSE) returns, default TRUE}

\item{warning.wgtsum}{a logical. wheather put out a warning when sum of the weights is not equal to 1 ?}
}
\value{
IF verbose is FALSE, return a return series of the portfolio, else, return a list with items:
  \itemize{ 
  \item rtn: a time series of the portfolio return.
  \item wgt_EOP: End of Period (BOP) Weight for each asset, with dims of \code{c(nrow(R), ncol(weights)+1)} .
  \item wgt_BOP: Beginning of Period (BOP) Weight for each asset, with dims of \code{c(nrow(R), ncol(weights)+1)} .
  \item contritution: The per period contribution to portfolio return of each asset, with dims of \code{c(nrow(R), ncol(weights)+1)}
  \item weights: weights
  \item rebtrade: a time series of the rebalancing trading of each asset, with dims of \code{c(nrow(weights), ncol(weights)+1)}, a  positive element means buying,and vice versa.
